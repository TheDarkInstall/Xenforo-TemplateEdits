# Xenforo-TemplateEdits
Selection of modified Template files from an Xenforo install.  Modifications made directly to template files, rather than using Xenforo back end; the site management system of Xenforo is very good, but has limits to how far modding can go.  

The modifications in these files relate to a specific install of XF, so are not applicable to any other XF site, but could provide ideas for other devs.
